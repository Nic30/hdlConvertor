The System Verilog and VHDL parser (and preprocessor) for Python/C++ written in C++. The lower layers are ANTLR4 generated parsers with full language support. Next layer converts this raw Verilog/VHDL AST to simple universal AST. So your project does not not have to care about Verilog/VHDL differences

It is also possible to convert this AST back to original HDL.

This project was extracted from [HWT](https://github.com/Nic30/hwt).
There is also Java version. But it seems that there is no use for it.


## Installation
Linux:
```
# note that only last 2 are really required rest is downloaded automatically as dependency
sudo apt install build-essential uuid-dev cmake default-jre python3 python3-pip libantlr4-runtime-dev antlr4
# note this may be older version than you see in repo
sudo pip3 install hdlConvertor

#or download repository and run
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
sudo python3 setup.py install
```
Or the same for python 2.7 with other options just for demonstration.

Installer also supports other commands.
```
# note that setting PYTHONPATH and params after install are there just for example and are not required 
export PYTHONPATH=/tmp/python_install/lib/python2.7/site-packages/
python setup.py install --prefix /tmp/python_install/ -j 8 --build-type Debug -- -DANTLR_JAR_LOCATION=../../../antlr4/antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar -- VERBOSE=1

Other commands:
python setup.py --help-commands
```

If you having issues take a look at .travis.yml (build script for the ubuntu 16.04).

Windows:

Take a look at appveyor.yml. It is required to download antlr4 first and have visual studio or other c++ compiler installed.

Also if it is something which is not unique to your system, tell us so we can fix it.


## Usage
The HDL AST (the parsed code) is represented by objects from `hdlConvertor.hdlAst`.
In the meantime when there is no wiki yet you can take look at src/hdlAst.py.
There are classes for objects in HDL langues and there is also type specified for every properrty.

Example of usage:
```python
from hdlConvertor.language import Language
from hdlConvertor.toVerilog import ToVerilog
from hdlConvertor import HdlConvertor
c = HdlConvertor()
filenames = ["your.v", ]
include_dirs = []
d = c.parse(filenames, Language.VERILOG, include_dirs, hierarchyOnly=False, debug=True)

tv = ToVerilog(sys.stdout)
tv.print_context(d)

for o in d.objs:
    print(o)
```
